= Troubleshooting deletion failure of a hosted control plane cluster on the Agent platform

When you destroy a hosted control plane cluster on the Agent platform, all the back-end resources are normally deleted. If the machine resources are not deleted properly, a cluster deletion fails. In that case, you must manually remove the remaining machine resources.

== Resolving the problem: Remove the remaining machine resources manually

Complete the following steps to destroy a hosted control plane cluster successfully on the Agent platform:

. Run the following command to see the list of remaining machine resources by replacing `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with the name of hosted cluster namespace:

+
----
oc get machine -n <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
NAMESPACE           NAME             CLUSTER          NODENAME   PROVIDERID   PHASE      AGE   VERSION
clusters-hosted-0   hosted-0-9gg8b   hosted-0-nhdbp                           Deleting   10h   4.14.0-rc.8
----

. Run the following command to remove the `machine.cluster.x-k8s.io` finalizer attached to machine resources:

+
----
oc edit machines -n <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----

. Run the following command to verify you receive the `No resources found` message on your terminal:

+
----
oc get agentmachine -n <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----

. Run the following command to destroy a hosted control plane cluster on the Agent platform:

+
----
hcp destroy cluster agent --name <cluster_name>
----

+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your cluster.
