= The {sco} flow

The {sco} dynamically generates installation manifests based on user-defined cluster templates that are instantiated from the data in the `ClusterInstance` CR.

You can source the `ClusterInstance` CR from your Git repository through ArgoCD, or you can manually create it on the hub cluster directly or through external tools and workflows.
//confused about "directly or through"

See the following process:
//-a list of steps but no procedure or link is odd to me

. Create one or more sets of cluster templates on the hub cluster.
. Create a `ClusterInstance` CR that references those cluster templates and supporting manifests.
. After the resources are created, the {sco} reconciles the `ClusterInstance` CR by populating the templated fields that are referenced in the CR.
//this is not a step, but the previous two are
. The {sco} validates and renders the installation manifests, then the Operator performs a dry run.
//same
. If the dry run is successful, the manifests are created, then the underlying Operators consume and process the manifests.
. The installation begins.
. The {sco} continuously monitors for changes in the associated `ClusterDeployment` resource and updates the `ClusterInstance` CR's `status` field accordingly.
//I am thinking this is just intro information to {sco} and would be in the intro.adoc file???
