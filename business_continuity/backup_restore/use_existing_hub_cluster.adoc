= Considerations when using an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster

If you use an existing hub cluster as a restore hub cluster with resources you created before the restore operation, you must understand the following constraints:

* Existing managed cluster are detached during the restore process.
* There are more resources on the restore hub cluster than the backup hub cluster.

[#existing-clusters-detached]
== Existing managed clusters are detached during the restore process

A detached managed cluster has content that does not match the content of the backup hub cluster. When you run a restore operation on your hub cluster that already manages some clusters and the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option set to `CleanupRestored`, the following outcomes occur:  

* Only when an earlier backup creates the `ManagedCluster` resources, the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation is set, and the backup managed clusters are not part of the restored backup, managed clusters are detached and the data is cleaned on the managed clusters.
 
* When the `ManagedCluster` resources are not created by an earlier backup and do not have the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation, `ManagedCluster` resources are not cleaned up. The managed clusters continue to be managed by your hub cluster.

[#restore-hub-resources]
== Restore hub cluster has more resources than the backup hub cluster

When you restore a hub cluster with earlier user-created data and the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option is set to `CleanupRestored` for the restore operation, the resources of your restore hub cluster do not match the resources of the primary hub cluster. The user data includes the following resources: `policy`, `application`, `credential`, or any custom resource defined by the user. The resources are not cleaned because the resources are created by the users and not created by an earlier backup.

If you intend to use an existing hub cluster for a restore hub cluster configuration and expect for the hub cluster to have the same content as the backup hub cluster after the restore is completed, tag any resource that you want to be part of a hub cluster backup. See xref:../backup_restore/tag_resources.adoc#tagging-resources[Tagging resources] for more information.
