[#uninstall-manual-remove-cr]
== Uninstalling and reinstalling earlier versions with an upgrade can fail
//2.10:10953 and 2:12:14343, to name a few issues for this

Uninstalling {acm-short} from {ocp-short} can cause issues if you later want to install earlier versions and then upgrade. For instance, when you uninstall {acm-short}, then install an earlier version of {acm-short} and upgrade that version, the upgrade might fail. The upgrade fails if the custom resources were not removed.

Follow the link:../install/cleanup_reinstall.adoc#cleanup-reinstall[Cleaning up artifacts before reinstalling] procedure to prevent this problem.

[#install-arm-diable]
== Infrastructure operator error with ARM converged flow
//2.9: 8558
 
When you install the `infrastructure-operator`, converged flow with ARM does not work. Set `ALLOW_CONVERGED_FLOW` to `false` to resolve this issue.

. Run the following command to create a `ConfigMap` resource:

+
----
oc create -f
----

. Apply your file by running `oc apply -f`. See the following file sample with `ALLOW_CONVERGED_FLOW` set to `false`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-assisted-service-config
  namespace: assisted-installer
data:
  ALLOW_CONVERGED_FLOW: false
----

. Annotate the `agentserviceconfig` with the following command:

+
----
oc annotate --overwrite AgentServiceConfig agent unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-service-configmap=my-assisted-service-config
----

The agent appears in the inventory when the issue is resolved.
