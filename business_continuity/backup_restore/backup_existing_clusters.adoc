[#backup-existing-clusters]
= Understanding outcomes for existing managed clusters during the restore process

Before you run the restore operation for existing hub clusters, understand the following constraints: 

* Existing managed cluster are detached during the restore process.
* The restore hub cluster can have more resources than the backup hub cluster.

[#existing-clusters-detached]
== Existing managed clusters can be detached during the restore process

If the hub you plan to use for the restore operation already manages some clusters, expect the following outcomes when you run a restore operation with the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option set to `CleanupRestored`:  

* If an earlier backup created the `ManagedCluster` resources, then the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation is set. Therefore, if you run a restore operation and use the `cleanupBeforeRestore=CleanupRestored` option, the clusters are detached and the data is cleaned up on the managed clusters. This only occurs if the backup managed clusters resources are not part of the restored backup.
* If the `ManagedCluster` resource does not have the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation, and you run a restore operation with the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option set to `CleanupRestored`, then the managed cluster resources are not cleaned up since they were not created by an earlier backup. Therefore, the managed clusters continue to be managed by this hub cluster, even though the clusters were not managed by the backup hub cluster, and this hub does not match the content of the backup hub cluster.

[#restore-hub-resources]
== Restore hub can have more resources than the backup hub

If your restore operation uses a hub with earlier created user data, then the restore operation results in a hub that does not have the exact content as the primary hub. The user data includes the following resources: `policy`, `application`, `credential`, or any custom resource defined by the user. A restore operation with the `cleanupBeforeRestore` option set to `CleanupRestored` is not going to clean up these resources because they were created by the users and not created by an earlier backup. 

If you intend to use an existing hub for a restore hub configuration and expect that the hub has the same content as the backup hub after the restore is completed, tag any resource that would be part of a hub backup with the `velero.io/backup-name: backupName` label annotation. To do so, complete the following documentation: xref:../backup_restore/backup_tag_resources.adoc#backup-tagging-resources[Tagging resources].
