= Cluster lifecycle with {mce-short} overview

The {mce-short} is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {ocp-short} and {acm-short} hub clusters. From the hub cluster, you can create and manage clusters, as well as destroy any clusters that you created. You can also hibernate, resume, and detach clusters. 

The {mce-short} is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {ocp} and {acm-short} hub clusters. If you installed {acm-short}, you do not need to install {mce-short}, as it is automatically installed.  

*Information:*

- Your cluster is created by using the {ocp-short} cluster installer with the Hive resource. You can find more information about the process of installing {ocp-short} clusters at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform_installation/4.15[Installing and configuring {ocp-short} clusters] in the {ocp-short} documentation.   

- With your {ocp-short} cluster, you can use {mce-short} as a standalone cluster manager for cluster lifecycle function, or you can use it as part of a {acm-short} hub cluster. 

- If you are using {ocp-short} only, the operator is included with subscription. Visit link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/architecture/about-the-multicluster-engine-for-kubernetes-operator[About {mce}] from the {ocp-short} documentation.

- If you subscribe to {acm-short}, you also receive the operator with installation. You can create, manage, and monitor other Kubernetes clusters with the {acm-short} hub cluster. 

- Release images are the version of {ocp-short} that you use when you create a cluster. For clusters that are created using {acm-short}, you can enable automatic upgrading of your release images. For more information about release images in {acm-short}, see xref:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/release_image_intro.adoc#release-images-intro[Release images].
