[#siteconfig-intro]
= {sco}

The {sco} offers a template-driven cluster provisioning solution, which allows you to provision clusters with all available installation methods.

The {sco} introduces the unified `ClusterInstance` API, which comes from the `SiteConfig` API of the `SiteConfig` generator kustomize plugin.

The `ClusterInstance` API decouples parameters that define a cluster from the manner in which the cluster is deployed.

This separation removes certain limitations that are presented by the `SiteConfig` kustomize plugin in the current link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/edge_computing/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) flow], such as agent cluster installations and scalability constraints that are related to Argo CD.

Using the unified `ClusterInstance` API, the {sco} offers the following improvements:

Isolation:: Separates the cluster definition from the installation method. The `ClusterInstance` custom resource captures the cluster definition, while installation templates capture the cluster architecture and installation methods.

Unification:: The {sco} unifies both Git and non-Git workflows. You can apply the `ClusterInstance` custom resource directly on the hub cluster, or synchronize resources through a GitOps solution, such as ArgoCD.

Consistency:: Maintains a consistent API across all installation methods, whether you are using the {ai}, the {ibio}, or any other custom template-based approach.

Scalability:: Achieves greater scalability for each cluster than the `SiteConfig` kustomize plugin.

Flexibility:: Provides you with more power to deploy and install clusters by using custom templates.

Troubleshooting:: Offers insightful information regarding cluster deployment status and rendered manifests, significantly enhancing the troubleshooting experience.

[#operator-flow]
== The {sco} flow

The {sco} dynamically generates installation manifests based on user-defined templates that are instantiated from the data in the `ClusterInstance` custom resource.

You can source the `ClusterInstance` custom resource from your Git repository through ArgoCD, or you can create it directly on the hub cluster manually or through external tools and workflows.

The following is a high-level overview of the process:

. You create one or more sets of installation templates on the hub cluster.
. You create a `ClusterInstance` custom resource that references those installation templates and supporting manifests.
. After the resources are created, the {sco} reconciles the `ClusterInstance` custom resource by populating the templated fields that are referenced in the custom resource.
. The {sco} validates and renders the installation manifests, then the Operator performs a dry run.
. If the dry run is successful, the manifests are created, then the underlying Operators consume and process the manifests.
. The installation begins.
. The {sco} continuously monitors for changes in the associated `ClusterDeployment` resource and updates the `ClusterInstance` custom resource's `status` field accordingly.
