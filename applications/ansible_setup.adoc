= Setting up {aap-short}

With {aap-short} jobs, you can automate tasks and integrate with external services, such as Slack and PagerDuty services. Your Git repository resource root path will contain `prehook` and `posthook` directories for {aap-short} jobs that run as part of deploying the application, updating the application, or removing the application from a cluster.
